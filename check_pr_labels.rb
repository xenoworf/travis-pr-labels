Usage: check_pr_labels.rb <OWNER> <REPO> <ISSUE> <IF_LABEL> <THEN_LABEL>

    Check a PR for a label named <IF_LABEL>. If <IF_LABEL> is present then the
    PR must also have <THEN_LABEL> or else the script exits with code 1.

    The script exits normally if:
        - <IF_LABEL> is not present
        - <THEN_LABEL> is present
        - Thus, also <IF_LABEL> and <THEN_LABEL> are present

    The script exits with code 1 if:
        - <IF_LABEL> is present but <THEN_LABEL> is absent.

Example: check_pr_labels.rb cerner terra-frameowrk 1553 'üöß Blocked: UX Input' '‚≠ê UX Reviewed'
